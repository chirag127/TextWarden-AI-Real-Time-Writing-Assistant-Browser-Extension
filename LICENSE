This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for direct, incidental, or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to You.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

If unenforceability cannot be avoided, then the provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to ensure enforceability.

e. No waiver of any provision of this Public License shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. Any waiver by the Licensor of any breach or default hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.

f. You may not assign this Public License or any of the rights granted hereunder without the prior written consent of the Licensor.
