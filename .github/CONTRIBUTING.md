# 🚀 Contributing Guidelines for TextWarden

Welcome to TextWarden! We are building an enterprise-grade, privacy-centric AI-powered browser extension for real-time writing assistance. Your contributions are invaluable in making TextWarden the most robust and user-friendly writing assistant available.

We adhere to a philosophy of **Zero-Defect, High-Velocity, Future-Proof** development. This means we value well-tested, clean, and maintainable code that can evolve with technological advancements.

## 1. Our Guiding Principles

*   **APEX STANDARDS:** We strive for FAANG-level quality in code, architecture, and documentation. Refer to the [Apex Technical Authority](https://github.com/example/repo/blob/main/.github/AGENTS.md) directives for detailed standards.
*   **SOLID Principles:** Ensure new code adheres to Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid redundant code. Abstract common logic into reusable functions or modules.
*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones, unless complexity is strictly required for performance or feature completeness.
*   **CQS (Command-Query Separation):** Methods should either perform an action (Command) or return data (Query), not both.
*   **Developer Experience (DX):** Contribute code that is easy to understand, test, and debug. Automated CI/CD and comprehensive tests are key.
*   **Security First:** All contributions must consider potential security implications (OWASP Top 10 2025). Input validation and sanitization are paramount.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for speed and resource efficiency, especially for a browser extension.
